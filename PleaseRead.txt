Latest version 1.2 contains an addition and a fix:
1) fixed client connect/re-connect time out. It did not work 
   when the server was not ready before the throttle 
   tried to connect, or when the connection was briefly lost.
   The throttle will retry to connect for up to 1 min.
2) added "select functions by name": Press F-key to step through
   function Groups where the last step is "F select". That displays
   function names that are available for the selected loco and their
   current state. Turning the speed knob steps through the functions, 
   push it to change its state. Press F-key to end or cancel.
